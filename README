=== Procinfo ===

Procinfo allows you to acces documentation for /proc tunables. For now, the data is being taken from the latest kernel 
"Documentation" tree. This can be improved later with more data from other sources.

The intention is to reduce time spent downloding, searching and grepping for information on the numerious tunables 
resent in a Linux system.

=== Install ===

$ python setup.py install

=== Usage ===

$ ./procinfo.py fs*
fs.dquot-max
fs.dentry-state
fs.overflowgid
fs.aio-nr
fs.super-max
...


$ ./procinfo.py fs.super-nr
fs.super-nr

These numbers control the maximum number of superblocks, and
thus the maximum number of mounted filesystems the kernel
can have. You only need to increase super-max if you need to
mount more filesystems than the current value in super-max
...
